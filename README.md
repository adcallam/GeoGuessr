# GeoGuessr_cv_bot
Description: A Python program that can determine the country on GeoGuessr "World" map 38% of the time.

This project only works on my personal computer for now (has not been tested on other resolutions, and uses specific file paths and stuff like that). 
This is my first ever programming project outside of school, so I apologize for how bad the code probably is. I didn't try to clean it up before uploading here, as the code should be able to provide sufficient understanding of how the program works the way it is.
