# GeoGuessr_cv_bot
Description: A Python program that can determine the country on GeoGuessr "World" map 38% of the time.

This project only works on my personal computer for now (has not been tested on other resolutions, and uses specific file paths and stuff like that). 
I apologize for the code being slightly messy. There was a time crunch to finish the program so I didn't have time to clean it up before uploading it here. However, I believe the code should be able to provide sufficient understanding of how the program works the way it is.
